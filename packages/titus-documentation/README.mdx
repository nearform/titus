# Documentation
Titus supports good documentation practices within the stack. This is achieved by using DocZ to pull together documents which are maintained under each package of the repo.

Documentation is handled by the [titus-documentation]() package. It's job is to coordinate the root structure of the documentation site, as well as provide the tooling to build and view the documentation.

Some documentation is stored in other packages. To capture these pages, titus-documentation scans all packages for .mdx files. These files are added to the documentation according to the meta in their header yaml.

## Viewing locally
A pre-built version of the documentation is available in the `docs/` folder in the root of the project. For convenience, this can be served locally by running the following command,

```sh
npm run docs:view
```

This comand can be ran in the root of the project or in the titus-documentation package itself.

Once ran, the documentation will be available at `localhost:3000`.

## Building
A static copy of the docs can be built for publishing to [Github Pages]() or some other static hosting site.

The built documentation site is written to the `doc/s` folder in the root of the project.

To build a new version of the documentation, run the following command,

```sh
npm run docs:build
```

This comand can be ran in the root of the project or in the titus-documentation package itself.

It is expected that any output from the build will be checked in, as it represents an update to the documentation.

## Development
Working with the documentation is easy, thanks to live reload.

```sh
npm run docs:Dev
```
