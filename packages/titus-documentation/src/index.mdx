# Titus

![foo](public/diagram-b.svg)

**Titus** is a fully featured starter kit, designed to accelerate projects. It contains a solid foundation for bootstrapping new projects, without writing the same boilerplate code again and again.

It is an opinionanted approach for starting a new application, but it's flexible enough to be tuned to match personal preferences.

It's different from application generators like [create-react-app]() (in fact, it builds on top of it), because the purpose of Titus is to showcase how we do things and provide code examples that can easily be reused, rather than a barebones application skeleton.

Therefore, while Titus can be used to create a new application, you can just as easily start with create-react-app and include the parts of Titus that you find useful.

On the other hand it's even easier to start with the Titus [sample application](/kitchen-sink) and remove the parts that you don't need.

## Overview
Titus is a Monorepo project that represents a full stack application. The primary constiuent parts are,

- [titus-kitchen-sink](): A client-side app generated using [create-react-app]()
- [titus-kitchen-sink-backend](): A server side app built using [hapi]()
- [titus-noise](): A deployment pipeline, using [noise]() that enables continious cloud delivery
- [titus-components](): A collection of various useful components for use (or deletion)

On top of these services Titus also provides some common sense infrastructure,

- A [PostgreSql]() database with and [adminer]() management frontend
- A [Redis]() deployment
- An [S3]() Faker service

It looks a little something like this,
