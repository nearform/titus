# Titus CLI

## Installation

Install the dependencies using either npm or yarn

```
npm/yarn install
```

## Developing

To use the local version of the cli in the command line we need to link it to our global packages and add the bin to our PATH.

```
npm link
```

NB. This doesn't work in yarn at the moment. There are several open issues about it, but it is not looking like something that will get resolved.
