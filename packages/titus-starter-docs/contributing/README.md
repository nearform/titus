# Contributing

## Code
Add some content here about accepting pull requests and other contributing tasks.

## Documentation
We welcome documentation contributions. Our documentation can be viewed live at [your-url][docs]

Documentation is in `docs/` folder. To host it locally, use the built-in command:

```sh
npm run doc:serve
```

It makes documentation available at `http://localhost:4000`.
Any edit to the files in `docs/` will automatically reload it.
