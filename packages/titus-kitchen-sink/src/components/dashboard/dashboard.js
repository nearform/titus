      <Typography paragraph>
        Titus is an opinionated sample application, created to showcase how we think about and develop software
        at <a href="https://nearform.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NearForm</a>.
        It is our belief that the mark of successful software is the reuse of common patterns and practices which
        have proven track records in production software. We are less caring about the minute of technical options
        available; instead preferring to look at the measure of value gained from the lens of a product owner or end
        user.

      <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>Making use of Titus</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Titus is not a singular app with a singular purpose, rather, it is a collection of Journeys composed
        together. A Journey
        is best thought of as a mini app with a singular function. Each Journey has been selected based on real
        world features we
        have developed. Often the biggest slow down in delivery of real value is having to reinvent the wheel over
        and over.
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Titus works like a style guide for software patterns and processes. Each sub section of the app contains a
        Journey through
        one of these patterns or processes. These Journeys are wrapped in a neat shell, powered by a backend server,
        and deployed as
        a full application to a real cloud service. In this way, we can demonstrate, not only popular Journey&#39;s
        product owners are
        likely to encounter, but also how to combine these journeys into a cohesive application that can be deployed
        using modern
        best practices.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>As a Starter Kit</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        We have built Titus with reuse in mind. No singular kit could hope to cover all possibilities. Instead we
        encourage you to take
        the bits you need and drop the parts you don&#39;t. Titus should be looked at as an accelerator, not as a
        set of rules or patterns
        that must be followed in an all or nothing scenario.
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        For example, perhaps you already have a rock solid Frontend Application built and deployed and are looking
        for a best practice backend
        that handles containerization, deployment and data migration. Or perhaps you would simply like to make use
        of some of the useful frontend
        journeys we have developed. We encourage you to mix and match as you needed.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>As Reference Architecture</Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Although Titus is a collection of Journeys. We have composed these Journeys into a full fledged application.
        This app includes the following
        features that make it a great reference Architecture for many classes of project.
