## Installation

Install dependencies for all packages using

```
npm install
```

This will install root package dependencies, including lerna, which will then install all sub package dependencies and link cross-dependencies.

Alternatively, if you have lerna installed globally, run

```
lerna bootstrap
```

Individual sub-packages are built during the bootstrap process

## Convenience Scripts

Some commands have been added to the root package for convenience.

| Command            | Description                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| postinstall        | runs 'lerna bootstrap' post install |
| build:component    | build the components project        |
| start:kitchen-sink | starts the kitchen sink app         |
