Titus includes a sample application called kitchen-sink. It is composed of a frontend and backend package. 

The [frontend](kitchen-sink-frontend.md) is built on [create-react-app](), with the addition of [Storybook](), [Material-UI](), [Reach Router](), [Apollo]() and more. It includes demos of open source client libraries we use, NearForm's own open source projects and design system. It also shows how to use the React components contained in the [titus-components](titus-components.md) package.

The [backend](kitchen-sink-backend.md) is built on [Hapi](https://hapijs.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and more. It also includes demos of open source backend libraries and NearForm's open source packages.
