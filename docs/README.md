Develop and Deploy to features in week one using Titus, an Accelerated Development & Deployment Stack. Titus is production ready can be deployed to all major cloud providers.

## Overview

The key goal of Titus is to enable you to get to building features in sprint one. We care a lot about this point. We use a modern deployment pipeline to ensure you can deliver continuously.

## Why we built this

## Getting started
The quickest way to get started is to view our quick start guide. It covers, forking, cloning, and pulling Titus local. From there it will walk you through configuration and deployment. All you need installed is the latest stable versions of [Docker]() and [Node]().
